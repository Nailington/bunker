## Plugins
Plugins are the core of Bunker. They power its entire functionality. Plugins can be whatever you want them to be - a chatroom, a notepad, or a retro emulator. Bunker comes pre-installed with some basic plugins to get you started. Installing plugins can be done in the Library menu within Bunker. These plugins are curated by the Bunker developers and are verified to be not malicious. If you wish, you may install external plugins via URL, however, they are not verified by us and may be malicious.

Developers can create their own plugins with our [plugin template](https://github.com/bunkerweb/template) and then publish them on the [plugin registry](https://github.com/bunkerweb/registry) to make it available for other Bunker users.
